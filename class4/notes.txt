JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />.
 Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags.
 You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:



 You can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces instead of quotes. For example, className="avatar" passes the "avatar" string as the CSS class, but src={user.imageUrl} reads the JavaScript user.imageUrl variable value, and then passes that value as the src attribute
 You can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces too, for example, string concatenation


  For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.
